# jQuery Mobile Site Tutorial

I was asked to give a workshop on jQueryMobile, which is a great mobile
framework being implemented by the jQueryMobile team, and I completely
tanked the presentation.

Several things caused it to go bad to worse, and I am truly sorry to
everyone who was hoping for awesomeness.  It just did not happen, I
would like to provide everyone that attended that class and anyone else
who would like to sink their teeth into jQueryMobile to take the time
to visit
[http://github.com/twilson63/jquery.mobile](http://github.com/twilson63/jquery.mobile)
and review the readme and index.html page.  You can also see the
jQueryMobile site live at
[http://twilson63.github.com/jquery.mobile](http://twilson63.github.com/jquery.mobile)

On the github project, there is an issues tab, if you have any questions
at all about jquerymobile or this project, please post them and I will
be glad to answer, if I can as soon as possible.  I know it does not
make up for the fail, but maybe it will help get you familar with
jQueryMobile.

Also, if you do not have a github account, e-mail them to jqm@jackhq.com
and I will post to the issues list and respond back to you as soon as
possible.

Sincerly,

Tom Wilson
