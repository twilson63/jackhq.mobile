# jQuery Mobile Site Tutorial

I was asked to give a talk on jQuery Mobile, which is a great mobile
framework being implemented by the jQueryMobile team, and I completely
tanked the presentation, because when asked how many people had been
using jQuery mobile everyone raised their hands.  I was shocked and
loat my place.  I am truly sorry to everyone that took their time to
come to the presentation.

While I wish I could get a redo, but I don't think that is possible.
Hopefully, I can do little to make it up by providing a post that takes
you true the building of a jQueryMobile Site.

## Single File App

jQueryMobile allows you to embed all your pages in a single file.  You
can also separate the pages into multiple files, but you will encounter
performance issues as your consumers switch from page to page.  So for
our site we will use the single file model.

## Create index.html
