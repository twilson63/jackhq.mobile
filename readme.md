# Jackhq Mobile

A pure static html jquery mobile site.  The purpose of this site is to
demonstrate the capabilities of the jQueryMobile Framework as a web site
vs trying to be a native mobile application.

## Web vs Native

There are many frameworks in this new mobile battle providing solutions.
JQueryMobile is making its way into this space and is currently a beta 
release.  The focus of jQueryMobile is to provide a great web browsing
experience on as many mobile devices as possible.  It is not necessarily 
trying to bring a native like presence as much as it is trying to create
a responsive/progressive enhancement for the mobile user.

## Easy

jQueryMobile is Easy and focuses on using HTML 5 Data Attributes to
drive the style and navigation of the site.  The product of this focus, 
brings a very nice and accessible experience across a large amount of 
browsers.
